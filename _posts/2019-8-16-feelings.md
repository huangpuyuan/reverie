鱼和熊掌不能得兼，你怎么选择：做得好，付出的代价可能是耗时长、成本高；做得快，意味着完成度低、不是精品。

我很赞同[一篇文章](http://jsomers.net/blog/speed-matters>)的结论：做得快更好。

>做得快不仅可以让你在单位时间内完成更多的工作，而且因为你工作得很快，所以你会觉得成本低，从而倾向于做更多。

写一篇博客，你可能需要两天。这是很高的时间成本，你觉得太贵了，于是你很少写。但是，做好一件事的唯一方法，就是多做这件事。 做得越快，这件事的时间成本就越低，你会愿意做得更多。

人们总是倾向于，多消费时间成本低的东西。网站很快，就会多访问；搜索很快，就会多搜索；文章很容易读懂，就会多读几篇。做得快的核心，就是要让时间成本降下来，从而多做。

### Speed matters: Why working quickly is more important than it seems

The obvious benefit to working quickly is that you’ll finish more stuff per unit time. But there’s more to it than that. If you work quickly, the cost of doing something new will seem lower in your mind. So you’ll be inclined to do more.

The converse is true, too. If every time you write a blog post it takes you six months, and you’re sitting around your apartment on a Sunday afternoon thinking of stuff to do, you’re probably not going to think of starting a blog post, because it’ll feel too expensive.

What’s worse, because you blog slowly, you’re liable to *continue* blogging slowly—simply because the only way to learn to do something fast is by doing it lots of times.

This is true of any to-do list that gets worked off too slowly. A malaise creeps into it. You keep adding items that you never cross off. If that happens enough, you might one day stop putting stuff onto the list.
